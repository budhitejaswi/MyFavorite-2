            I love reading!
            The first reason is because it brings a story to life and when I am reading I feel like I am in the story like a ghost watching the story happen and I am in a different world and I am invisible to the real world.
            Another one is that it inspires me to use my imagination and I learn many new things.
            Reading helps me "escape reality" and go into a whole new world.
            Also whenever I am feeling sad I pick a good book and I immediately feel happy and I think that's because I can relate to at least one of the characters.
            I also love to see how the character's delevop and learn to grow and how much they have grown from the beginning.
